**Frontend Communication:**
- Use REST for the Frontend because it's a common and familiar way for external clients to communicate with HTTP RESTful services.

**Mobile Device Data:**
- For handling the large volume of location data from mobile devices, opt for gRPC. REST might cause delays or timeouts in this scenario.

**Server Implementation:**
- gRPC server is implemented within the location route as a producer. This choice ensures quick response/request times and aligns with microservice application best practices.
- Location service functions as a Kafka consumer to handle the data efficiently.
